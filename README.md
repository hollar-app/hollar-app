Hollar is an online ordering platform for small businesses and restaurants.

### What it does

Hollar allows restaurant owners to set up an online ordering platform in minutes. With an easy to use menu-creator, admin portal to view trends and revenue, kiosk to see incoming orders, and customer facing menu website, Hollar is a one stop shop for restaurants to get online in an increasingly digitized world. 

In other words, Hollar.app is a static site generator for restaurants to get their menuâ€™s online, without needing to resort to website builders or outsource developers. We make it simple to set up an online ordering platform.

### How we built it

We built our front end with next.js, react, and javascript. Our backend was entirely hosted on Google Cloud, using Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Functions to manage routes. We hosted our next.js website on Vercel. Cloud Functions Repository: https://github.com/HollarApp/hollar-firebasey
